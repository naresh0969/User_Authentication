# User_Authentication
This project uses Node.js, Express, MongoDB, EJS, and JWT for user authentication. Users can sign up, and their details are securely stored with encrypted passwords. On login, a JWT token is generated and stored as a browser cookie. Logging out clears the cookie, ensuring secure and efficient session management.
